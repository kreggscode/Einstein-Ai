    "location": "Old Grove Rd., Nassau Point, Peconic, Long Island",

    "summary": "Einstein's famous letter warning about Nazi Germany's potential to develop atomic weapons, which led to the Manhattan Project.",
    "historicalContext": "Written just weeks before World War II began, this letter changed history. Einstein, a pacifist, felt compelled to warn the US about nuclear weapons development.",
    "letterText": "Sir:\n\nSome recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration.\n\nI believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:\n\nIn the course of the last four months it has been made probable through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America‚Äîthat it may be possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.\n\nThis new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable‚Äîthough much less certain‚Äîthat extremely powerful bombs of this type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory.\n\nHowever, such bombs might very well prove too heavy for transportation by air.\n\nThe United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is in the Belgian Congo.\n\nIn view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America.\n\nOne possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust the task with a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an unofficial capacity.\n\nHis task might comprise the following:\n\na) to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.\n\nb) to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining co-operation of industrial laboratories which have necessary equipment.\n\nI understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizs√§cker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.\n\nYours very truly,\nAlbert Einstein",

    "letterText": "Dear Phyllis,\n\nI will attempt to reply to your question as simply as I can. Here is my answer:\n\nScientists believe that every occurrence, including the affairs of human beings, is due to the laws of nature. Therefore a scientist cannot be inclined to believe that the course of events can be influenced by prayer, that is, by a supernaturally manifested wish.\n\nHowever, we must concede that our actual knowledge of these forces is imperfect, so that in the end the belief in the existence of a final, ultimate spirit rests on a kind of faith. Such belief remains widespread even with the current achievements in science.\n\nBut also, everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe, one that is vastly superior to that of man. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is surely quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive.\n\nWith cordial greetings,\nYour A.

Thus, in the inquiry now proposed, I can do little more than seek to clarify the question at issue and, clearing the ground of the more obvious solutions, enable you to bring the light of your far-reaching knowledge of man's instinctive life to bear upon the problem.\n\nHow is it possible for this small clique to bend the will of the majority, who stand to lose and suffer by a state of war, to the service of their ambitions?\n\n...[The letter continues with Einstein's analysis of power, nationalism, and education]\n\nI know that in your writings we may find answers, explicit or implied, to all the issues of this urgent and absorbing problem. But it would be of the greatest service to us all were you to present the problem of world peace in the light of your most recent discoveries, for such a presentation well might blaze the trail for new and fruitful modes of action.\n\nYours very sincerely,\nA.
